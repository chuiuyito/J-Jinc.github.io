                    It only a matter of seconds between you making a 100k profit or a 100k lost. We are a new innovating company tired of seeing people taking a lost just because their computer was not fast enough, or was oversaturated to make that specific transaction that determine a great wealth. My name is Jesus and I started trading when I was in college. At first I learn the hard way because I didn’t have anyone to guide me though the right path and one of my biggest problem was my computer. It was outdated, I didn’t know how to install programs or the required programs from my broker and that was really stressful, most of the time I was not able to sell my shares on time because my software was supper slow, and my computer overheated because the amount of power that the charts takes. One day I met Jesus a software engineering student who was into pc gaming who happened to see me struggling with my computer and offer me some help. After that we became friends, we built a computer from scratch with better software supper fast that my red days became green 85% of the time that’s when we decided to help other people that want to start trading in the stock market or for those that are already trading to know that there are better options that will make your tool the best of all.
